# Stuff that will (hopefully) be added to this tutorial

This tutorial is not complete. It still needs:

- Dictionaries and tuples (can be in the same thing since tuples
    are needed for dict keys)
- Explain `for a, b in thing` somewhere
- **More exercises and examples everywhere!**
- Exceptions
- explain bool(x) and why it matters
- classes part 2
    - non-public `_variables`
    - singular inheritance, inheritance of built-in classes
    - using super
- no classes part 3 with multiple inheritance, it's not something people need
- quick overview of some of the most useful built-in functions and classes
    - range
    - zip
    - classmethod and staticmethod
- iterables and iterators: something most Python programmers need to be
    aware of
- last chapter: "What should I do now?" links to other resources
    - GUI programming tutorials
        - easygui
        - tkinter in effbot (warn the readers about star imports)
        - pyqt5 in zetcode
        - gtk+ 3 in readthedocs
    - a pygame tutorial
    - David Beazley's metaprogramming and other talks
    - a regex tutorial


## Fix these

- the chapter about installing python should mention that python 2 and 3
    can be and often are installed at the same time
