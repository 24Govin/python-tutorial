# Stuff that will (hopefully) be added to this tutorial

This tutorial is not complete. It still needs:

- Dictionaries and tuples (can be in the same thing since tuples
    are needed for dict keys)
- Explain `for a, b in thing` somewhere
- **More exercises and examples everywhere!**
- reading and writing files
    - first of all: what are files, directories/folders and paths
    - print(..., file=thefile), not thefile.write(...)
    - show how to iterate over the file and .read() it
    - why .rstrip('\n') instead of .strip()
    - files remember their position, reading the same file object twice
- modules
    - just files and folders, have a look at Python's lib directory
    - "batteries included" filosofy
    - briefly introduce some of the most commonly used standard library
        modules:
        - math
            - it's not a file, what is it?
        - sys
            - sys.exit() vs exit()
        - time
        - os, os.path, subprocess
        - random
        - webbrowser
    - explain even more briefly and link to documentation/tutorials:
        - configparser
        - textwrap
        - collections, itertools, functools
        - traceback
        - types
        - warnings
        - json
    - link to third party modules:
        - appdirs
        - requests
- Exceptions
- explain bool(x) and why it matters
- classes part 2
    - non-public `_variables`
    - singular inheritance, inheritance of built-in classes
    - using super
- quick overview of some of the most useful built-in functions and classes
    - range
    - zip
    - classmethod and staticmethod
- iterables and iterators: something most Python programmers need to be aware of
- classes part 3: multiple inheritance
    - an advanced thing
    - built-in classes don't use it
    - diamond diagrams, why to use super()
- last chapter: "What should I do now?" links to other resources
    - GUI programming tutorials
        - easygui
        - tkinter in effbot (warn the readers about star imports)
        - pyqt5 in zetcode
        - gtk+ 3 in readthedocs
    - a pygame tutorial
    - David Beazley's metaprogramming and other talks
    - a regex tutorial
