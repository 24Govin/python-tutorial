# Stuff that will (hopefully) be added to this tutorial

This tutorial is not complete. It still needs:

- range somewhere
- Better lists chapter, also introduce tuples in it
- **More exercises and examples everywhere!**
- explain bool(x) and why it matters
- classes part 2
    - non-public `_variables` (maybe reading PEP-8 is enough to explain this?)
    - "singular" inheritance, inheritance of built-in classes
    - using super
- no classes part 3 with multiple inheritance, it's not something people need
- iterables and iterators: something most Python programmers need to be
    aware of
- last chapter: "What should I do now?" links to other resources
    - GUI programming tutorials
        - easygui
        - tkinter in effbot (warn the readers about star imports)
        - pyqt5 in zetcode (warn about mixedCase)
        - gtk+ 3 in readthedocs
    - a pygame tutorial
    - David Beazley's metaprogramming and other talks
    - "What the heck is this?" section for stuff i haven't talked about
        - regexes
        - yield
