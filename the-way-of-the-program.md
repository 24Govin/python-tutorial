# ThinkPython: The way of the program

ThinkPython is a free Python book. Its first chapter is about
programming in general. Read it
[here](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2002.html).
Read the glossary also, but don't study it too much. Some things in it
are useful to know, but I think studying it carefully would be really
boring.

When you're done reading, read the summary and make sure you've learned
everything.

## Summary

- Now you should have some kind of idea about what programming is.
- Each value has a type, and you can find that out with `type(value)`.
    For example, writing `type(123)` to the Python prompt does the same
    thing as writing `int` to the prompt.
- Types and classes are the same thing (in Python 3).
- Some of the most commonly used types are:
    - int is short for integer. `1` and `2` are ints.
    - float is short for floating point number. `1.0` and `3.14` are floats.
    - str is short for string. `"hello"` and `'hello'` are strings. It
        doesn't matter if you use 'single quotes' or "double quotes",
        they do the same thing in Python.
