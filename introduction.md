# Quick introduction to this tutorial

I started writing a full Python tutorial, but I stopped when I realized
that it would be a lot of work. Instead, I started adding links to other
free tutorials. Since much of this is collected from different places
around the Internet, you will end up reading about some things twice.
Just skip them and move on :)

Everything in this tutorial contains lots of examples, and the tutorial
should be easy to follow. But what should you do if you don't understand
something the first time you read it?

- Read the example code and the explanation for it again.
- Try the example yourself.
- If there's something you haven't seen before in the tutorial and it's
    not explained, try to find it from the previous chapters. Also feel
    free to come back to previous chapters of this tutorial while doing
    the exercises!
- If you still have trouble understanding the tutorial or any other
    problems with the tutorial, please [tell me](contact-me.md). I want
    to improve the tutorial so other readers won't have the same
    problems as you have.

One of the most important things with learning to program is to **not
fear mistakes**. If you make a mistake, your computer will not break in
any way. You'll get an error message that tells you what's wrong and
where. Even professional programmers do mistakes and get error messages
all the time, and there's nothing wrong with it.

Even though a good tutorial is an important part about learning to
program, you also need to learn to make your own things. Use what you
have learned, and create something with it.

## Summary

- Now you should know what to do if you don't understand something.
- Don't fear mistakes.
- Error messages are your friends.
- Don't be limited to this tutorial, also make your own programs.
