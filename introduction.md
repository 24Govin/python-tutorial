# Quick introduction to this tutorial

I started writing a full Python tutorial, but I stopped when I realized
that it would be a lot of work. Instead, I'm currently combining it with
links to other free tutorials, so some day it should be all you need to
get started with Python.

Everything in this tutorial contains a lot of examples, and the tutorial
should be easy to follow. But what should you do if you don't understand
something the first time you read it?

1. Read the example code and the explanation for it again.
2. Try the example yourself.
3. If you still don't understand, please [tell me](contact-me.md). I want
    to improve the tutorial so other readers won't have the same problem
    as you did.

One of the most important things with learning to program is to
**not fear mistakes**. If you make a mistake, your computer will not
break in any way. You'll get an error message that tells you what's
wrong and where. Even professional programmers do mistakes and get error
messages all the time, and there's nothing wrong with it.

Even though a good tutorial is an important part about learning to
program, you also need to learn to make your own things. Use what you
have learned, and create something with it.

### Summary

- Now you should know what to do if you don't understand something.
- Don't fear mistakes.
- Error messages are your friends.
- Don't be limited to this tutorial, also make your own programs.
