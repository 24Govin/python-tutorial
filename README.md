# Python programming tutorial

[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_\(programming_language\))
is a high-level, interactive and object-oriented programming language.
Its simple syntax makes it easy to learn and fast to work with, so it's
a great choice for a first programming language.

No tutorial is good for everyone. This one is aimed at people with no
programming experience at all or very little programming experience. If
you have programmed a lot in the past using some other language you
probably want to read
[the official tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) instead.

This tutorial uses Python 3, and you need Python 3 to be able to run the
example code yourself. Python 2 is getting outdated all the time,
and more and more projects are moving to Python 3. There are a few
popular libraries that don't support Python 3 that well at the time of
writing this, but you don't need to worry about that just yet. They
will probably support Python 3 by the time you've learned the basics
and you may actually need them.

I have tested most of the code in this tutorial on Python 3.4, but
everything should also work on any Python 3 version or newer.

Here's a list of chapters in this tutorial. Read them one by one in the
order they are listed. **If you jump to a chapter without reading and
understanding everything before it, you may have hard time understanding
the chapter you're trying to read.** However, the chapters are mostly
independent from each other, so you can also use this tutorial together
with other tutorials.

I'm Akuli and I have written most of this tutorial, but the following
people have helped me with it:
- [SpiritualForest](https://github.com/SpiritualForest): Lots of typing
    error fixes.
