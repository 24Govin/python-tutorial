# Python programming tutorial

[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_\(programming_language\))
is a high-level, interactive and object-oriented programming language.
Its simple syntax makes it easy to learn and fast to work with, so it's
a great choice for a first programming language.

No tutorial is good for everyone. This one is aimed at people with no
programming experience at all or very little programming experience. If
you have programmed a lot in the past using some other language you
probably want to read
[the official tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) instead.

This tutorial uses Python 3. Python 2 is not under active development
anymore, and more and more projects are moving to Python 3. There are a
few popular libraries that don't support Python 3 that well at the time
of writing this, but you don't need to worry about that just yet. They
will probably support Python 3 when you've learned the basics and you
need them.

Here's a list of chapters in this tutorial. Read them one by one in the
order they are listed, unless you already know some things.

1. [Quick introduction to this tutorial](introduction.md)
2. [Installing Python](installing-python.md)
3. [Installing Python and using it as a calculator](1.md)
4. [Strings, variables, Booleans and None](2.md)
5. [Using functions and storing code in files](3.md)
6. [If, elif, else and while](4.md)

I'm Akuli and I have written most of this tutorial, but the following people have helped me with it:
- [SpiritualForest](https://github.com/SpiritualForest): Lots of typing
    error fixes.
- [theelous3](https://github.com/theelous3): Small improvements and fixes.
