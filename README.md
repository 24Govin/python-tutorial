# Python programming tutorial

[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_\(programming_language\))
is a high-level, interactive and object-oriented programming language.
Its simple syntax makes it easy to learn and fast to work with, so it's
a great choice for a first programming language.

No tutorial is good for everyone. This one is aimed at people with no
programming experience at all or very little programming experience. If
you have programmed a lot in the past using some other language you
probably want to read
[the official tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) instead.

This tutorial was written in Python 3, and you need Python 3 or newer to
be able to run the example code yourself. Python 2 is getting outdated
all the time, and more and more projects are moving to Python 3. There
are a few popular libraries that don't support Python 3 that well at the
time of writing this, but you don't need to worry about that just yet.
They will probably support Python 3 by the time you've learned the
basics and you may actually need them.

I have tested most of the code in this tutorial on Python 3.4, but
everything should also work on Python 3.3, 3.2 and all newer Pythons.
