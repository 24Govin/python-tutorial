# Python programming tutorial 
 
[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_\(programming_language\)) is a high-level, interactive and object-oriented programming language. Its simple syntax makes it a great choice for a first programming language for a beginner. 
 
No tutorial is good for everyone. This one is aimed at people with no programming experience at all. If you have programmed in the past with some other language you probably want to read [the official tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) instead. Like most other tutorials, this tutorial starts with math. You can skip that if you hate math. 
 
This tutorial uses Python 3. Python 2 is not under active development anymore, and more and more projects are moving to Python 3. Currently there are a few packages that don't support Python 3 that well at the time of writing this (such as twisted), but if you haven't programmed yet Python 3 is a great choice. 
 
In this tutorial (and in most other tutorials) it's completely fine to simply read nothing but the example code, then come back and read the explanation for it if you don't fully understand it. There's nothing wrong with not reading every word in the documentation when all you need is the example code. 
 
This tutorial includes lots of footnotes _[*]_. They are for people who want to know more about something in more detail and for people who would otherwise complain about how my tutorial is wrong about some things. There's often links to awesome resources such as tutorials and videos. If you've finished reading my tutorial and doing the exercises I recommend reading the footnotes and other places they point to. 
 
_[*] Footnotes are like this._ 
 
Most importantly, when learning a programming language you need to **experiment fearlessly and try new things that you did not read from a tutorial**. It's almost impossible to break your computer accidentally with Python. 99% of the time typing something wrong will simply make an error message that tells you what's wrong, it will not destroy anything.
