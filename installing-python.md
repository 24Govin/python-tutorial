# Installing Python

If you want to learn to program with Python using this tutorial, you
need to try out the code examples. You could use a website like
[repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/python3), but I highly recommend
installing Python. That way you don't need to open a web browser just to
write code, and you can work without an Internet connection.

Let's get started!

### Downloading and installing Python

#### Windows

1. Go to [the official Python website](https://www.python.org/).
2. Move your mouse over the blue Downloads button, but don't click it,
    Then click the button that downloads the latest version of Python.
3. Run the installer.
4. Select the "advanced installation" option, and make sure the py.exe
    launcher gets installed.

#### Mac OSX

I don't have an up-to-date copy of Mac OSX. If you would like to write
instructions for OSX, [tell me](contact-me.md).

#### GNU/Linux

You already have Python, there's no need to install it. If you 

If you want to use IDLE (see below), install it. The name of the package
is `idle3` on Debian-based distributions, like Ubuntu and Linux Mint,
and you can install it with a software manager like any other program.
On other distributions you can just search for idle using the
distribution's package manager.

### Running Python

Now you have Python installed. There are several ways to run Python:

1. Directly from PowerShell, command prompt or terminal.
2. Using IDLE.
3. Using something else.

I'm not going to focus on the third option in this tutorial, but if you
know how to use Python with something else than PowerShell, command
prompt, a terminal or IDLE it's fine. Do whatever you want.

#### If you like working with PowerShell, command prompt or terminal

On Windows. you should be able to run Python from a PowerShell window,
or a command prompt window if you don't have PowerShell. Open one of
these programs from the start menu or start screen, type there `py` and
press Enter. You should see something like this in it:

    C:\Users\You> py
    Python 3.4.4 (v3.4.4:737efcadf5a6, Dec 20 2015, 19:28:18)
    [MSC v.1600 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>>

On GNU/Linux or Mac OSX, type `python3` instead:

    you@YourComputer:~$ python3
    Python 3.4.3 (default, Oct 14 2015, 20:28:29) 
    [GCC 4.8.4] on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> 

Now type `exit()` and press Enter to get out of Python.

#### If you are not an advanced user and you have no idea what PowerShell, command prompt and terminal are

Use IDLE. Experienced Python users will say that IDLE is garbage, but
don't listen to them. These people want you to use "better" alternatives
with more features, but that's exactly what you don't want as a
beginner. You should spend as little time as possible learning your
tools, and as much time as possible learning Python. Advanced
programming tools are not going to help you at all with this.

Launch Python's IDLE like any other program. You should see something
like this:

![IDLE](idle.png)

From now on, I'll instead show everything like this, so I don't have to
take more screenshots:

    Python 3.4.3 (default, Oct 14 2015, 20:28:29)
    [GCC 4.8.4] on linux
    Type "copyright", "credits" or "license()" for more information.
    >>>

The exact content of your Python's welcome message is probably different
than mine, it's ok.

### Summary
- Now you should be able run Python.
