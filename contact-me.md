# Contact me

If you have any trouble with the tutorial or you would like to improve
it, there are a few ways to contact me:

- Create an issue on GitHub.

    This is probably the best choice if you had trouble following the
    tutorial, and something in it should be explained better. Click
    [here](https://github.com/Akuli/python-tutorial/issues/new) to
    create an issue. You will be asked to create a GitHub account if you
    don't already have one.

- Tell me on IRC.

    I'm usually on
    [##learnpython on freenode](https://kiwiirc.com/client/chat.freenode.net/##learnpython).
    You don't need to register anywhere, just click the link and you're
    good to go. If there's no Akuli in the user list, try again after a
    few hours. Maybe we are not on the same time zone.

    If you need to post a code example that is more than two lines long,
    post it [here](http://dpaste.com/) first. Just copy-paste your code
    to the big text area and click the "Paste it" button. Then post a
    link to your paste on IRC.
